# Kuka youBot Simulation in CoppeliaSim

For this project, I simulated different motion plan trajectories for the Kuka youBot, a mobile omnidirectional robot with a manipulator. Each simulated trajectory involved
the Kukabot picking up a box from a starting location and placing it at a goal location. There were three simulated trajectories in total,  a 'best' trajectory, an 'overshoot' trajectory 
and a 'new task' trajectory. The three separate cases are distuinguished by using different types of feedback control and/or different starting conditions for the Kukabot and box. The simulations
were created in CoppeliaSim.

The file under the 'code' directory shows the template used to generate the three seperate trajectories. The three seperate cases are included in this file, but only the 'best case' is actually used. The other cases are commented out, and their respective scripts can be found and ran in the corresponding directory under the results directory.

Below are the demo videos for each trajectory simulation.
