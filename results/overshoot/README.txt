# ME449 Overshoot Case File
Author: Allan Garcia

For the 'overshoot' case, the type of controller used was a feedforward-plus-P-plus-PI. The gains were Kp=1.2 and Ki=0.9.
The error plots show that there was relatively good overshoot on the Roll and Z twist variables. These two oscillate slightly as they try to converge, and the Roll error seems to converge sooner at around 800 timesteps while th Z error converges closer to the end of the entire trajectory at around 1400 timesteps.
