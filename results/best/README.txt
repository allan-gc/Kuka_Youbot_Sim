# ME449 Best Case File
Author: Allan Garcia

For the 'best' case, the type of controller used was a feedforward-plus-P-plus-PI. The gains were Kp=2.0 and Ki=0.05.
The error plots show that there was good convergence of the error to zero around the end of the first trajectory (~150 timesteps), yet there was a small increase at around 800-900 timesteps. Tuning the gains showed no improvement but also had no real effect in the robot successfuly grabbing the box and moving it to another location.
