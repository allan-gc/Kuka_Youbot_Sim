# ME449 NewTask Case File
Author: Allan Garcia

For the 'newTask' case, the type of controller used was a feedforward-plus-P-plus-PI. The gains were Kp=2.0 and Ki=0.05. For this case, the new initial box configuration was at x=1.0, y=0.5, z=0.025, and the final box configuration was as x=0.2, y=-0.4, and z=0.025
The error plots show that there was much better convergence of the error to zero around the end of the first trajectory (~150 timesteps). There is still an error on the linear Z variable at around 800 timesteps but it seems to have a smaller amplitude here as opposed to the 'best' case. The simulation for this case also ran successfully.
